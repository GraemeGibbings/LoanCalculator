# LoanCalculator
Simple loan calculator for learning CLI with Python

Learning outcomes:
You will practice using mathematics and Python in everyday tasks and learn how to use third-party modules and libraries. You will also learn more about different financial instruments. At one point, you will need to parse arguments, so working on this project is a great opportunity to get to know the command-line interface (CLI) better as well.
